    "`RADIS-lab` uses the JupyterLab environment, and is deployed for you on [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/). The session will timeout after ~1hr of inactivity. You'll still be able to download your notebooks on timeout. You can also save/restore directly to your browser storage. \n",

    "JupyterLab can be improved with extensions. Open the `Extension Manager` on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "[mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) provides 2 Gb of RAM by default. This is enough for calculations with the HITRAN database but may be limiting for HITEMP. [GESIS.org](https://notebooks.gesis.org/) can host JupyterLab with up to 8 Gb RAM for public users and 32 Gb for registered users. We are also looking for institutions to host RADIS-lab on clusters with large RAM access. "
